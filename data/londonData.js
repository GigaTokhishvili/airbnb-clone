Cloth Fair/Middle St is a famous filming location and has been featured in Sherlock, Four Weddings & A Funeral, The Imitation Game and many other movies.",
        "notes": "Are you looking at other listings? Here is why I think this room is the best choice: •  Travel links - many of the other central London rooms are a hefty walk from the nearest tube station. Here you are just a 1 minute walk from Barbican station. •  One guest at a time - beware of dodgy listings where hosts have several 'private rooms' in one building. This can mean sharing an apartment with four of five other guests, with one bathroom between you. This is a two bedroom apartment and I am the only other person staying here. •   Space - too many London Airbnbs offer tiny 'box rooms' with no room to unwind and unpack. You will have the largest bedroom in the apartment with plenty of wardrobe space. •  Amenable host - although I won't get in your way, I am around to help however I can during your stay. I've taken many Airbnb trips before, so I know what it's like to have a good host. •   Local knowledge - I have lived in London for 6 years and very knowledgeable on how to get around and g",

If you are working in London, I am happy to agree a slot (e.g. 7am - 8am) when the bathroom is all yours - whatever is easiest for you. Ordinarily I will be out of the apartment by 8am, but I will make sure my schedule does not get in your way. At weekends, I sometimes use the sitting room/dining room for working or studying  - however, if you want to the use the sitting room, I am more than happy to make way for you.",
        "interaction": "I am around to chat and help you make your way around London. I am very knowledgeable about the local neighbourhood and can make recommendations on restaurants, bars etc. I am also an expert on saving money in London. I can help you get cheap (£20 max) tickets to West End theatre shows, save money on London transport, get free WiFi on the go, or find 2-for-1 deals at nearby restaurants. I travel regularly on Airbnb in Europe and the US myself, so am very familiar with how it works and what makes a good host.",

There is a comfy sofa for guests to use where you can put your feet up in the evenings, kick back and relax! This sofa also converts into a single sofa bed so you can comfortably sleep up to 5 people in this flat.  The living area is also home to the dining area, which is the perfect spot to enjoy some local delicacies. Top tip, try out Borough food market over the bridge for some tasty treats to take home.

Business travellers will love the fact that it is just a stone throw to the City which is the financial hub of Europe. Visitors to London who love to stroll the city and take in the amazing sights and architecture will love that the flat is just a 2 minute walk to the riverside and Millennium Bridge. Culture vultures rejoice, you are just seconds away from St Paul's Cathedral is just seconds away from the flat! Finally, shoppers can shop to their heart;s content in the nearby renowned shopping centre 'One New Change'. In addition to shops, it also offers different entertainment and restaurant options.",

        "transit": "Blackfriar's tube station is a 4 minute walk away and St Paul's cathedral is a 7 minute walk away. Together these stations are serviced by the central, circle and district lines. These tube lines will take you directly to Bond Street, Marble Arch and Oxford Circus (the best stations for shopping in London). You can also get to Westminster and Chelsea.  There is a bus stop to pretty much anywhere in central London which is a 30 second walk away on Ludgate Hill. Buses are a great way of travelling if you like to have a peek at your surroundings as you travel.  A great local tip is to download the Citymapper app. This free app will plan your journey for you efficiently and quickly. It gives you a variety of different transport options such as bike, rail, tube and Uber taxi. It will also take you step by step through your journey as you travel and notify you when you are nearing your destination.",
